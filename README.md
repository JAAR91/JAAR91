<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

Hello there, I am a full-stack software developer that loves to code. I am currently looking for a job that brings new challenges and lets me grow as a developer. I want to become a top-of-the-line software developer. 

I enjoyed building websites and finding solutions for new problems. I can work on teams but prefer to work remotely.

I just finished a 12-month program called Microverse, where I worked on projects with people from all around the world. Building websites with excellent UI using:
- HTML
- CSS
- RUBY
- RUBY ON RAILS
- JAVASCRIPT
- REACT AND REDUX

I also know about using unit tests like Rspec for rails and jest for javascript.

A bit about me, I love to watch movies, play video games and music. I play the guitar and the drums. I love cats, but for now, I have three dogs that I love too.
